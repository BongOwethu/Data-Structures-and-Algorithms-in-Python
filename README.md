*My NeetCode 150 Practice Problems. <br /><br />
Neetcode 150 is a curated list of 150 LeetCode problems designed to cover all possible patterns & topics in data structures. <br />
Mainly practicing in ``` C ``` , ``` C++ ``` , ``` Rust ``` , ``` Python ``` , ``` JAVA ``` & ``` JavaScript ```.<br /> 
The list was created by Neetcode-gh - https://github.com/neetcode-gh, originally based on another list called blind 75 with 75 problems.<br />

## About 📜 
📹 NeetCode is a YouTuber who posts coding solutions to LeetCode questions. NeetCode used to be a N.E.E.T (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) but has recently become a Software Engineer at Google. Neetcode is one of the best YouTubers at explaining solutions to LeetCode, as not only does he provide both a brute force and optimal solution, but he goes into detail regarding the actual algorithm and/or data structure needed to find the optimal solution.

👩‍💻 NeetCode.io was created for people to prepare for coding interviews in a more efficient way. NeetCode.io has organized coding questions into categories with the intention to learn how to solve the patterns typically seen in these coding interview questions, rather than picking a random LeetCode problem or two a day.

💻 NeetCode wanted to create a resource in which anyone could learn how to answer coding interview questions by recognizing that pattern and applying that pattern to find the optimal solution.

📖 On NeetCode.io, NeetCode has kindly categorized 150 questions, which include the Blind 75, on the website. Each pattern has a series of questions, ranging from easy-hard LeetCode difficulty. Each question links back to the LeetCode problem of the same name, where you can try to solve it.

📚 NeetCode also includes both his own video solution, where he goes in-depth on how to
solve the problem, as well as various code answers. All the LeetCode questions have answers in Python, and nearly all also have answers in Java, C++, and JavaScript, so you can study and understand the solution.
